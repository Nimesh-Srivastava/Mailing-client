# TCP Chat Room

## 💢 About
* This is a program to create your own private chat room over the internet.<br>
* It uses TCP, hence the name.<br>
* To host the room, edit the `server.py` to fill in the correct ip address and port number.
* For people to join, edit the `client.py` with correct ip address and port number, and send it to people.
* There is no limit to the number of people joining the server, however there is a limit on the length<br>
of text message (it is of 1024 Bytes) that can be sent.
<br>

**⚠️ Only admin can `kick` and/or `ban` other users.**
