# TCP Chat Room

This is a program to create your own private chat room over the internet.<br>
It uses TCP, hence the name.<br>

***
:warning: **This is a private room, but the data transmission is not encrypted. Be careful what you say and who you talk to.**
***

To host the room, edit the `server.py` to fill in the correct ip address and port number.

For people to join, edit the `client.py` with correct ip address and port number, and send it to people.

There is no limit to the number of people joining the server, however there is a limit on the length<br>
of text message that can be sent.
