# Mail Client

Secure mailing client (SSL) in python.

* Python version => 3.9
* smtp server => Google
* port => 465

### Code breakdown :
* `password.txt` is used for storing the password of gmail account.
* `message.txt` is used to store the mail that is to be sent.
* `Image 31-10-21 at 4.02 PM.jpeg` acts as an attachment, demonstrating the client's ability to send attachments as well.

Ideally, the password file should be encrypted and then stored. While performing the server login, the file should be decrypted in program and used.
